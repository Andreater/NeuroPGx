**NeuroPGx** helps to identify pharmacogenomics profiles based on subjects genotype of five core genes(**???**). NeuroPGx was developed using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), see [papers](#papers) for details and citations. Developed by the <a href="https://www.hsantalucia.it/en/molecular-genetics-laboratory-uildm" target="_blank">Genomic Medicine Laboratory</a> at <a href="https://www.hsantalucia.it/en" target="_blank">IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation</a>. You can reach us at **email please**.

## Key features
- Explore: Quickly and easily summarize, visualize, and analyze your data
- Cross-platform: It runs in a browser on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Reproducible: Recreate results and share work with others
- Programming: Integrate NeuroPGx's analysis functions with your own R-code

## How to use 
NeuroPGx is an open-source platform-independent browser-based interface for pharmacogenomics in R. The application is based on the Shiny package and can be run locally or on a server. If you want to run NeuroPGx locally you should install the latest version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Andreater/NeuroPGx/issues) on GitHub to suggest enhancements or report problems.

## Diplotype assignation
The automatic identification of diplotypes based on genotypes at selected genes is based on CYP genes following [CPIC](https://cpicpgx.org/) allele definition. All possible diplotypes are evaluated for their enzymatic phenotype based on [PharmVar data](https://www.pharmvar.org/) and the frequency in the [reference population](https://cpicpgx.org/).
